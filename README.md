# Real-Time-Infectious-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project involves a real-time Infectious Disease Analysis and Prediction App
This project is a Streamlit app designed to analyze and predict trends in infectious diseases in real time. 
Using open-source datasets and CDC APIs, it provides interactive visualizations and predictive analytics to assist researchers, public health officials, 
and decision-makers in monitoring and managing disease outbreaks.

Key Features include: 

Real-Time Data Retrieval: Fetches live data on infectious diseases from open APIs (e.g., HealthMap API).
Includes data fields like case counts, locations, disease types, and time.
Data Visualization:

Line charts to display trends over time: Interactive geographic maps showing the spread of diseases.
Heatmaps for hotspots of infectious disease outbreaks.
Predictive Analysis:

Machine Learning Model: Uses machine learning models to forecast disease trends for future days or weeks.

User-Friendly Filters: Select disease type, region, and time frame for customized analysis.
Real-time updates every minute for dynamic monitoring.
